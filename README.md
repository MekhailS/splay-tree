# splay tree
## Realization of splay tree data structure on C language.

#### Supported operations:
  - Insert
  - Search
  - Delete
  
### Basic interface:
  - a <string> insert element <string> to tree
  - f <string> find element <string> in tree
  - r <string> remove element <string> from tree
  
#### Studying of data structure's operation complexity (relationship between time and number of elements in tree) 
  - main module of studying is .c
  - results is .txt
  - plotting script is .py

#### All non-trivial functions are covered with unit tests 

## Plots of relationship between time and number of elemts in tree for operations (insert, search, delete)
