# splay tree
## Realization of splay tree data structure on C language.

#### Supported operations:
  - Insert
  - Search
  - Delete

#### Studying of data structure's operation complexity (relationship between time and number of elements in tree) 
  - main module of studying is .c
  - results is .txt
  - plotting script is .py

#### All non-trivial functions are covered with unit tests 

## Plots of relationship between time and number of elemts in tree for operations (insert, search, delete)
